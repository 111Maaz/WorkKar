## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
-   A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account for the backend.

### Local Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
    cd wo-c-main
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase:**
    -   Log in to your Supabase account and create a new project.
    -   Inside your project, go to the **SQL Editor** and run the SQL script located in `supabase/migrations/` to create the necessary tables (`workers`, `profiles`, etc.).
    -   Navigate to **Project Settings > API**.
    -   Find your **Project URL** and `anon` public key.
    -   Create a new file named `WorkKar.env` by copying the example. Add your Supabase credentials to it:
        ```
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        ```
    -   **Deploy Edge Functions for Admin Actions:**
        -   Install the Supabase CLI if you haven't already:  
            `npm install -g supabase`
        -   Log in:  
            `supabase login`
        -   Deploy the approval function:  
            `supabase functions deploy approve-change-request`
        -   Make sure your Supabase project has the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set for secure function access.

> **Note:** The admin panel's "Approve" button for change requests will not work unless the edge function is deployed.

    > **Note:** The project's sign-up form inserts data directly into the database and does not use Supabase Auth. Make sure your Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `workers` and `profiles` tables allow for public inserts if you have RLS enabled.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## üîí Security Notes

-   **Admin Actions:** Changing sensitive user data (like email) is only possible via secure Supabase Edge Functions, not from the client/browser.
-   **RLS Policies:** Ensure your Row Level Security (RLS) policies allow the necessary operations for your app to function (see Supabase docs).

## üßπ Codebase Cleanup

The codebase has been cleaned to remove all mentions of placeholder names and has been standardized to use the "WorkKar" branding and iconography.

## üìç Location Handling

When a user selects their location (either by pin-pointing on the map or using the "Use My Location" button):

- The app fetches the **full, human-readable address** using the Nominatim API and saves it as the `location_address` (text) in the database.
- The app saves the **coordinates** as a geometry value (WKT, e.g., `POINT(lng lat)`) in the `location_coordinates` (geometry) column.
- This is required for distance calculation and for users to find nearby workers.
- If either value is missing, the profile cannot be saved or updated.

**Example:**
- `location_address`: `Murad Nagar, Ward 70 Mehdipatnam, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Central Zone, Hyderabad, Asif Nagar mandal, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500264, India`
- `location_coordinates`: `0101000020E61000000009005B649C5340157C7159BC633140`

This logic applies to both profile updates and worker sign-up.
