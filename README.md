## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
-   [bun](https://bun.sh/) (or `npm`/`yarn`)
-   A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account for the backend.

### Local Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
    cd wo-c-main
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```
    *(Or `npm install` if you are using npm)*

3.  **Set up Supabase:**
    -   Log in to your Supabase account and create a new project.
    -   Inside your project, go to the **SQL Editor** and run the SQL script located in `supabase/migrations/` to create the necessary tables (`workers`, `profiles`).
    -   Navigate to **Project Settings > API**.
    -   Find your **Project URL** and `anon` public key.
    -   Create a new file named `WorkKar.env` by copying the example. Add your Supabase credentials to it:
        ```
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        ```
    > **Note:** The project's sign-up form inserts data directly into the database and does not use Supabase Auth. Make sure your Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `workers` and `profiles` tables allow for public inserts if you have RLS enabled.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## üßπ Codebase Cleanup

The codebase has been cleaned to remove all mentions of placeholder names and has been standardized to use the "WorkKar" branding and iconography.
